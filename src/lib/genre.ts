/**
 * release.v2 genre slug constants + helpers. Ported from the glmps web viewer
 * so genre handling stays identical across the websites and this app.
 *
 * Source of truth: schema/release.v2.json — keep this file in sync with the
 * grouped `genreSlugs` (acoustic / electronic / bridge / tertiary). The
 * grouping is semantic + palette ONLY — not a hierarchy; all 38 active slugs
 * are pure peers. Validation policy is strict-but-recoverable: unknown slugs
 * are dropped silently, never thrown.
 *
 * The four original compound slash-pairs were retired in the 2026-06
 * restructure (split/collapsed into atomic slugs). They live on in
 * GENRE_DEPRECATED: never emitted on new events, but still VALID for reading
 * legacy events and cross-relay copies, where they render with a slash (see
 * genreLabel).

 *    cosmetic — doesn't affect filter matching) and `rnb` reads as "R&B".
 * 2. Legacy slash-display: the retired compound pairs render with a slash
 *    (`classical-folk` → `classical/folk`, etc.) when encountered in legacy
 *    events. Set-gated, not a blind regex, so atomic hyphen slugs like
 *    `hip-hop`, `lo-fi`, and `boom-bap` render verbatim.
 * 3. Everything else passes through unchanged.
